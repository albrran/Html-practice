        <h1>Ryan Albright</h1>
        <h2>CS Student at the University of Georgia</h2>

        <p>Hi, my name is Ryan Albright and I am currently a third-year student at the University of Georgia. Ever since I was young, I had a passion for exploring new ideas,concepts, and pushing the boundaries of what I know. This passion has led me to pursue a degree in computer science, where I have been exploring java, HTML, SQL, and CSS and while learning new skills that I am excited to apply in software engineering and web development. In my free time, you can often find me tinkering with new programming projects or experimenting with new technologies, always striving to broaden my understanding of the world around me. I am grateful for the opportunities that UGA has provided me to continue growing as a programmer, and I am excited to see where my love for learning will take me in the future!</p>

        <h2>Featured Projects</h2>
        <p>Most of my projects are school related, and are therefore private to abide by UGA's academic code. However, I hope to add more personal projects that I learn from my classes and attempt to apply them in unique settings. Recently, I've been planning the idea to create a battleship game using javaFX and java inheritance as a baseline for the attributes of the ships</p>
